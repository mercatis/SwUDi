<h1>LUIseV3 for SwUDi</h1>

    A <a href="http://www.wallbraun-electronics.de/produkte/lcdusbinterfacev301/index.html">LUIseV3</a> implementation for SwUDi.

    It uses <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/javaftd2xx/pages/Home">JavaFTD2XX</a> to access the device.
    Unfortunately I do not know a maven repository, so you have to upload it manually to your repository:

<pre>
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=JavaFTD2XX-0.2.6.jar -DgroupId=com.ftdi.FTD2XX -DartifactId=FTD2XX -Dversion=0.2.6
-Dpackaging=jar
</pre>

    <h2>Hints for using Linux:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>ftd2xx needed rw access to the usb device, you will get an jvm crash, is you do not have write access:

<pre>
libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/019: Permission denied.
libusb requires write access to USB device nodes.

            -> either fix your udev scripts, or just give yourself write access: "chmod 666 /dev/bus/usb/002/019"

            for fixing your udev do
            <pre>
            echo 'SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001",GROUP="users", MODE="0666"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-LUIseV3.rules
            </pre>
            as root
        </li>

        <li>ftd2xx did not find a device, eg:

<pre>
05.12.2011 13:33:09 com.ftdi.FTDevice getDevices
INFO: Found devs: 0 (All:1)
no device found
</pre>

            the problem maybe is that linux loads some modules, if you plugin a ftdi-device -> ftdi_sio, usbserial.
            You have to remove them when using ftd2xx -> "rmmod ftdi_sio usbserial" as root, or fixing your udev...

        </li>

        <li>INVALID_HANDLE : In my linux env in 2 out of 5 tries i get
        <pre>
Exception in thread "main" com.ftdi.FTD2XXException: D2XX error, ftStatus:INVALID_HANDLE
        </pre>
            I'm not sure why, just restart the application...
            -> this is a problem of 64-bit platforms as JavaFTD2XX did not handle them correctly -> i patched it to support 64bit also -> see
            <a href="https://github.com/arminhaaf/JavaFTD2XX">JavaFTD2XX fork</a>
        </li>
        </ul>
